    "\n",
    "The task we'll be working with is summarization, aka we want to generate a summary of our text. In this particular case, emails. Finding a good model for summarization is a daunting task, as the typical intuition that larger parameter models generally perform better goes out the window. For summarization, we need to consider the input, which will likely be of a longer context size, and finding models that efficiently deal with those longer contexts is of paramount importance. In our business case, which is to create summaries of conversation threads, much as you might see in Slack or an email chain, the models need to be able to extract key information from those threads while still being able to accept a large context window to capture the entire conversation history.We identified that it is far more valuable to conduct abstractive summaries, or summaries that identify important sections in the text and generate highlights,  rather than extractive ones, which pick a subset of sentences and add them together for our use cases since the final interface will be natural language. We want the summary results not to need to be interpreted from often incoherent text snippets produced by extractive summaries. \n",

The term ground truth comes from geology and geospatial sciences, where actual information was collected on the ground to validate data acquired through remote sensing, such as satellite imagery or aerial photography. Since then, the concept has been adopted in other fields, particularly in machine learning and artificial intelligence, to refer to the accurate, real-world data used for training and testing models. \n",

However, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the Add-ons for Thunderbird public listing. URL to ATN listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. Thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server I have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on ATN. Since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to ATN at all.My best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from ATN,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the XPI files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (I think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted XPI points to the correct update.json.

The full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nStarting with Thunderbird 128, the API documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the WebExtension APIs added by Thunderbird, but also those inherited from Firefox (Thunderbird and Firefox share a significant amount of code).

It is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nWithin the Zulip chats (same for Slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to PDF files, etc... when I left-click on these, the Thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. Probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nBut I if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. It takes me to Firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the PDF, and so on...\\n\\nIs there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to Firefox? Or to make it all work within Thunderbird?\\n\\nPS: my extension is quite simple and I'm still learning a lot of details. Please feel free to give feedback and tips on what I should improve.

It appears those do not work as expected in Thunderbird. Filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nThe link handler of Thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same Thunderbird tab. Links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nTo change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  Add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"&lt;all_urls&gt;\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nYou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. In the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventDefault();\\nevent.stopPropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(anchor.getAttribute('href'));\\n}\\n\\nDoes this help?\\n\\nJohn\\n\\nYes, at the moment I confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nRegarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but I have a busy day of work today. I'll test this changes later tonight and I'll reply here if it works.\\n\\nI've just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nFirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. In zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. To make these work, I need to add the Zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nTo make this work, I had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get('zulip_url');\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startsWith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventDefault();\\n    event.stopPropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendMessage({\\n        data: anchor.getAttribute('href')\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nI'll try this for a couple of days to see if I spot other issues. If you have any suggestion on how I can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks for the help,\\nBest regards,\\nGerson</td>\n",

       "      <td>I think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how Thunderbird works internally, but I thought I would ask anyway.\\n\\nWhen you set mail.tabs.drawInTitlebar=true in the Config Editor, the OS-supplied titlebar -- with the window title and the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons -- is hidden, and Thunderbird-supplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead.  This is great.\\n\\nAnother thing that happens is that you can DRAG in the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window to move the Thunderbird window around, as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose.  This is also great.\\n\\nI have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension I have been working on.  I can hide the OS-supplied titlebar and add my own buttons, and that is working well, but I cannot figure out how to make it so I can drag on my extension's toolbox/toolbars to make the windows for my extension's move.\\n\\nI seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for Thunderbird's main window (and the message view and compose windows.)  Using the Developer Toolbox, I just add Attribute chromemargin=\"0,2,2,2\" (or chromemargin with ANY values, actually) to the &lt;html&gt; tag in the HTML/XUL for the Thunderbird window.  It's like magic.  Add the chromemargin Attribute, and the titlebar disappears, and you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.  Remove the chromemargin Attribute and the titlebar re-appears and you CANNOT drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.\\n\\nThis does not work for the windows for my extension.  Dragging on the toolbox/toolbars does nothing.\\n\\nI have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the Toolbox/toolbars that would respond to mouse drags and I cannot see anything.  Perhaps it's something in the source code for the app itself?  Or some other value stored somewhere, some toolbox or toolbar ID, or CSS class, or attribute or something.  I just don't know.\\n\\nI have tried looking at the Thunderbird source code, and I understand it a bit, but not well enough to figure this out.\\n\\nIf you have any knowledge of this, could you please give me some help?\\n\\nMany thanks in advance,\\n---Mark\\nJust in case anyone is interested in this, user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillaZine:\\n\\nhttp://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3121128&amp;sid=d068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63</td>\n",

       "0  I recently added a beta release, version 7.0b1, of my extension, Clippings for Thunderbird, and selected the option to self-host it so that I can make it available to testers separately while regular users continue to see version 6.3.5, the current release version. However, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the Add-ons for Thunderbird public listing. URL to ATN listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. Thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server I have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on ATN. Since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to ATN at all.My best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from ATN,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the XPI files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (I think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted XPI points to the correct update.json. John I've removed the beta version of my extension from ATN, and the listing for my extension now shows the current stable release.

       "1  the Thunderbird team is preparing the next big release: Thunderbird 128 ESR. Now is a good time to check if your add-ons are compatible. Thunderbird 128 is currently being shipped through the beta release channel. If you have not already installed Thunderbird Beta, you can get it from Thunderbird's download page [1]: Select the desired language, your operating system, and switch the \"release channel\" selection to \"Beta\".\\n\\nA list of known required changes to make add-ons compatible with Thunderbird 128 can be found on developer.thunderbird.net [2]. These changes mostly affect Experiment add-ons, which directly interact with Thunderbird code. WebExtensions usually do not need updates, but the add-ons team had to introduce the messagesUpdate permission, and browser.messages.update() will stop working, if the new permission has not been requested.\\nAnother notably change is the official support of Manifest Version 3 in Thunderbird 128. The add-ons team removed deprecated elements and made additional changes to resolve inconsistencies in the APIs. The full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nStarting with Thunderbird 128, the API documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the WebExtension APIs added by Thunderbird, but also those inherited from Firefox (Thunderbird and Firefox share a significant amount of code). We are listing only methods, which are actually supported and working.\\n\\nDo not hesitate to reach out for help [5]. Looking forward to see your add-ons running in Thunderbird 128!\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n\\n[1] : https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/\\n[2] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb128\\n[3] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html\\n[4] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/stable/\\n[5] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "2  Hi all, Well I think everything is in the title. We have an extension that shows pdf thumbs in the message pane (faster than openning them). We used to provide PDF.js. Is this still needed? Regards, We usually do not encourage add-ons to depend on files shipped with Thunderbird, because the file could be moved/renamed, which will break your add-on. Ship your own version, so your add-on always uses a known version and stays compatible, even if Thunderbird updates its internal file, which might include API changes which could break your add-on as well.

       "3  I'm studying how to develop addons. So, I'm sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nMy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/Zulip-Thunderbird\\n\\nThe extension adds an icon to open the Zulip team chat on a Thunderbird tab. The purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. It is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nWithin the Zulip chats (same for Slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to PDF files, etc... when I left-click on these, the Thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. Probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nBut I if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. It takes me to Firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the PDF, and so on...\\n\\nIs there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to Firefox? Or to make it all work within Thunderbird?\\n\\nPS: my extension is quite simple and I'm still learning a lot of details. Please feel free to give feedback and tips on what I should improve. I have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nGerson\\n\\nHm,\\n\\nI do not know if it is related: Do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? It appears those do not work as expected in Thunderbird. Filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nThe link handler of Thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same Thunderbird tab. Links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nTo change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  Add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nYou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. In the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventDefault();\\nevent.stopPropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(anchor.getAttribute('href'));\\n}\\n\\nDoes this help?\\n\\nJohn\\n\\nYes, at the moment I confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nRegarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but I have a busy day of work today. I'll test this changes later tonight and I'll reply here if it works.\\n\\nI've just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nFirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. In zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. To make these work, I need to add the Zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nTo make this work, I had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get('zulip_url');\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startsWith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventDefault();\\n    event.stopPropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendMessage({\\n        data: anchor.getAttribute('href')\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nI'll try this for a couple of days to see if I spot other issues. If you have any suggestion on how I can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks for the help,\\nBest regards,\\nGerson\n",
       "4  I think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how Thunderbird works internally, but I thought I would ask anyway.\\n\\nWhen you set mail.tabs.drawInTitlebar=true in the Config Editor, the OS-supplied titlebar -- with the window title and the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons -- is hidden, and Thunderbird-supplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead.  This is great.\\n\\nAnother thing that happens is that you can DRAG in the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window to move the Thunderbird window around, as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose.  This is also great.\\n\\nI have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension I have been working on.  I can hide the OS-supplied titlebar and add my own buttons, and that is working well, but I cannot figure out how to make it so I can drag on my extension's toolbox/toolbars to make the windows for my extension's move.\\n\\nI seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for Thunderbird's main window (and the message view and compose windows.)  Using the Developer Toolbox, I just add Attribute chromemargin=\"0,2,2,2\" (or chromemargin with ANY values, actually) to the <html> tag in the HTML/XUL for the Thunderbird window.  It's like magic.  Add the chromemargin Attribute, and the titlebar disappears, and you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.  Remove the chromemargin Attribute and the titlebar re-appears and you CANNOT drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.\\n\\nThis does not work for the windows for my extension.  Dragging on the toolbox/toolbars does nothing.\\n\\nI have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the Toolbox/toolbars that would respond to mouse drags and I cannot see anything.  Perhaps it's something in the source code for the app itself?  Or some other value stored somewhere, some toolbox or toolbar ID, or CSS class, or attribute or something.  I just don't know.\\n\\nI have tried looking at the Thunderbird source code, and I understand it a bit, but not well enough to figure this out.\\n\\nIf you have any knowledge of this, could you please give me some help?\\n\\nMany thanks in advance,\\n---Mark\\nJust in case anyone is interested in this, user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillaZine:\\n\\nhttp://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3121128&sid=d068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "

       "0     i recently added a beta release version 70b1 of my extension clippings for thunderbird and selected the option to selfhost it so that i can make it available to testers separately while regular users continue to see version the current release version however the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the addons for thunderbird public listing url to atn listing httpsaddonsthunderbirdnetenusthunderbirdaddonclippingstb thanks for the report it is best to file an issue with the addonsserver httpsgithubcomthunderbirdaddonsserver i have not looked at it in detail but selfhosted addons need an updateurl entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on atn since we do not sign addons selfhosted addons do not need to be submitted to atn at allmy bestpractice advice is remove the beta version from atn create a dedicated branchrepo which holds the update information either a branch in each addon repo you want to selfhost or a single updaterepo with the information for all your addons host the xpi files either as an beta asset in a github release or directly as a file in the repo i think the asset is the better choice make sure that the manifest of your selfhosted xpi points to the correct updatejson john ive removed the beta version of my extension from atn and the listing for my extension now shows the current stable release thanks for your help                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "2     hi all well i think everything is in the title we have an extension that shows pdf thumbs in the message pane faster than openning them we used to provide pdfjs is this still needed regards we usually do not encourage addons to depend on files shipped with thunderbird because the file could be movedrenamed which will break your addon ship your own version so your addon always uses a known version and stays compatible even if thunderbird updates its internal file which might include api changes which could break your addon as well john                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3     im studying how to develop addons so im sorry if my question is noob my code is here httpsgithubcomgersonjferreirazulipthunderbird the extension adds an icon to open the zulip team chat on a thunderbird tab the purpose is to concentrate all chatemail apps into a single window it is a simple extension and it is working fine but within the zulip chats same for slack or other examples there are external links or links to pdf files etc when i leftclick on these the thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black probably because it cannot show the save as dialog or open with and so on but i if rightclick and select open in browser it works fine it takes me to firefox and opens the desired link or downloads the pdf and so on is there a way to fix this so that the leftclick takes me to firefox or to make it all work within thunderbird ps my extension is quite simple and im still learning a lot of details please feel free to give feedback and tips on what i should improve i have no idea how many people would be interested in using it best regards gerson hm i do not know if it is related do all those broken atags have a targetblank attribute it appears those do not work as expected in thunderbird filed a bug for it httpsbugzillamozillaorgshowbugcgiid1905616 the link handler of thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same thunderbird tab links to other sites will open in the default browser to change this behaviour you can use a content script add this to your manifest contentscripts matches allurls js contentscriptjs you may limit the content script to a more strict match if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension in the content script define a global clickhandler windowaddeventlistenerclick clickhandler function clickhandlerevent eventpreventdefault eventstoppropagation const anchor eventtargetclosesta if anchor return browserwindowsopendefaultbrowseranchorgetattributehref does this help john yes at the moment i confirm that all links that fail have targetblank so it seems related to the bug you are reporting regarding you suggestion it sounds promising but i have a busy day of work today ill test this changes later tonight and ill reply here if it works ive just tested your suggestion and it helped me identify some details first indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with targetblank for sure but not all of then in zulip there are links that start with useruploads like useruploadsblablapdf and these are the broken ones in my addon to make these work i need to add the zulip prefix httpsmyorgzulipchatcom useruploadsblablapdf to make this work i had to split your suggestion into a background and a contentscript code like this backgroundjs browserruntimeonmessageaddlistenerfunction message prefix browserstoragesyncgetzulipurl prefixthenfunctionresult let prefix resultzulipurl href messagedata if hrefstartswithuseruploads href prefix href browserwindowsopendefaultbrowserhref and contentscriptjs windowaddeventlistenerclick clickhandler function clickhandlerevent eventpreventdefault eventstoppropagation const anchor eventtargetclosesta if anchor return browserruntimesendmessage data anchorgetattributehref ill try this for a couple of days to see if i spot other issues if you have any suggestion on how i can improve this code please let me know thanks for the help best regards gerson\n",
       "4     i think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how thunderbird works internally but i thought i would ask anyway when you set mailtabsdrawintitlebartrue in the config editor the ossupplied titlebar with the window title and the minimizemaximizerestoreclose buttons is hidden and thunderbirdsupplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead this is great another thing that happens is that you can drag in the toolboxtoolbars at the top of the window to move the thunderbird window around as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose this is also great i have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension i have been working on i can hide the ossupplied titlebar and add my own buttons and that is working well but i cannot figure out how to make it so i can drag on my extensions toolboxtoolbars to make the windows for my extensions move i seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for thunderbirds main window and the message view and compose windows using the developer toolbox i just add attribute chromemargin0222 or chromemargin with any values actually to the html tag in the htmlxul for the thunderbird window its like magic add the chromemargin attribute and the titlebar disappears and you can drag the window around using the toolboxtoolbars at the top of the window remove the chromemargin attribute and the titlebar reappears and you cannot drag the window around using the toolboxtoolbars at the top of the window this does not work for the windows for my extension dragging on the toolboxtoolbars does nothing i have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the toolboxtoolbars that would respond to mouse drags and i cannot see anything perhaps its something in the source code for the app itself or some other value stored somewhere some toolbox or toolbar id or css class or attribute or something i just dont know i have tried looking at the thunderbird source code and i understand it a bit but not well enough to figure this out if you have any knowledge of this could you please give me some help many thanks in advance mark just in case anyone is interested in this user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillazine httpforumsmozillazineorgviewtopicphpt3121128sidd068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "95    whoever thought monochrome icons were better than colored or coloured ones must have a strange outlook on life whats wrong with having a background color attribute for icons which if a user wants monochrome can all be set the same i use tabs a lot and particularly dislike the release tabs all being black white arguments about how to make icons readily distinguishable by shape miss the point colour is the obvious way to make different tab categories immediately distinguishable even if all black white is the default the user should be able to assign colours by category like the previous version where all tabs containing regular folders were yellow for example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "96    first of all id like to chime into the voices lauding thunderbird and yes there is also something that i repeatedly came to miss in thunderbird lately for me it would be really helpful to be able to search the folder pane since i do really have a lot of folders i have done a quick search and i found that i am not the only one there are addons to implement this function which currently seem to be not ready for tb though inshttpsdiscoursemozillaorgtsearchfolderpaneinthunderbird751763ins id think this is something that would come in handy for many users so it would be nice to have it implemented in tb itself not as addon what do you think best harry correction ive seen that of the addons link below do actually work with current version of tb and one of those does exactly what i looked for harry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "98    i can not believe that this is not an automatic feature why is the view layout message pane not remembered per each folder that is to have the option to remember user persist per the account per folder inbox drafts sent archives junk trash imo it can be dangerous in the spamjunk folder to have it on depending on how the email message options are configured for external links etc but most of the time i wish for trashjunk and few other folders to not have the message pane on but say my inbox or drafts or sent to have it toggled on i am stuck with a button combo of f8 to toggle on off as i move my mouse to different folders i would think that other layout options to stay configured as toggled by user then the global setting overriding all would be useful not really asking any more confusing gui toggle but simple user persist setting that overrides the default f8 now the behavior of default install vs this global toggle might be a good option to have a restore default that would put all folders back to onoff message pane globally now how it is to be implemented be it per folder type inbox drafts sent or individual i do not know i would be happy with some option though besides the current state if their is a way please do tell because this is annoying and would seem like it should be a feature by default also i do not think that an addon should be required for this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

However, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the Add-ons for Thunderbird public listing. URL to ATN listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. Thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server I have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on ATN. Since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to ATN at all.My best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from ATN,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the XPI files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (I think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted XPI points to the correct update.json.

       "1   the Thunderbird team is preparing the next big release: Thunderbird 128 ESR. Now is a good time to check if your add-ons are compatible. Thunderbird 128 is currently being shipped through the beta release channel. If you have not already installed Thunderbird Beta, you can get it from Thunderbird's download page [1]: Select the desired language, your operating system, and switch the \"release channel\" selection to \"Beta\".\\n\\nA list of known required changes to make add-ons compatible with Thunderbird 128 can be found on developer.thunderbird.net [2]. These changes mostly affect Experiment add-ons, which directly interact with Thunderbird code. WebExtensions usually do not need updates, but the add-ons team had to introduce the messagesUpdate permission, and browser.messages.update() will stop working, if the new permission has not been requested.\\nAnother notably change is the official support of Manifest Version 3 in Thunderbird 128. The add-ons team removed deprecated elements and made additional changes to resolve inconsistencies in the APIs. The full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nStarting with Thunderbird 128, the API documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the WebExtension APIs added by Thunderbird, but also those inherited from Firefox (Thunderbird and Firefox share a significant amount of code). We are listing only methods, which are actually supported and working.\\n\\nDo not hesitate to reach out for help [5]. Looking forward to see your add-ons running in Thunderbird 128!\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n\\n[1] : https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/\\n[2] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb128\\n[3] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html\\n[4] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/stable/\\n[5] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "2   Hi all, Well I think everything is in the title. We have an extension that shows pdf thumbs in the message pane (faster than openning them). We used to provide PDF.js. Is this still needed? Regards, We usually do not encourage add-ons to depend on files shipped with Thunderbird, because the file could be moved/renamed, which will break your add-on. Ship your own version, so your add-on always uses a known version and stays compatible, even if Thunderbird updates its internal file, which might include API changes which could break your add-on as well.

       "3   I'm studying how to develop addons. So, I'm sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nMy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/Zulip-Thunderbird\\n\\nThe extension adds an icon to open the Zulip team chat on a Thunderbird tab. The purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. It is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nWithin the Zulip chats (same for Slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to PDF files, etc... when I left-click on these, the Thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. Probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nBut I if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. It takes me to Firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the PDF, and so on...\\n\\nIs there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to Firefox? Or to make it all work within Thunderbird?\\n\\nPS: my extension is quite simple and I'm still learning a lot of details. Please feel free to give feedback and tips on what I should improve. I have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nGerson\\n\\nHm,\\n\\nI do not know if it is related: Do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? It appears those do not work as expected in Thunderbird. Filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nThe link handler of Thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same Thunderbird tab. Links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nTo change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  Add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nYou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. In the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventDefault();\\nevent.stopPropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(anchor.getAttribute('href'));\\n}\\n\\nDoes this help?\\n\\nJohn\\n\\nYes, at the moment I confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nRegarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but I have a busy day of work today. I'll test this changes later tonight and I'll reply here if it works.\\n\\nI've just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nFirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. In zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. To make these work, I need to add the Zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nTo make this work, I had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get('zulip_url');\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startsWith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventDefault();\\n    event.stopPropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendMessage({\\n        data: anchor.getAttribute('href')\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nI'll try this for a couple of days to see if I spot other issues. If you have any suggestion on how I can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks for the help,\\nBest regards,\\nGerson   \n",
       "4   I think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how Thunderbird works internally, but I thought I would ask anyway.\\n\\nWhen you set mail.tabs.drawInTitlebar=true in the Config Editor, the OS-supplied titlebar -- with the window title and the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons -- is hidden, and Thunderbird-supplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead.  This is great.\\n\\nAnother thing that happens is that you can DRAG in the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window to move the Thunderbird window around, as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose.  This is also great.\\n\\nI have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension I have been working on.  I can hide the OS-supplied titlebar and add my own buttons, and that is working well, but I cannot figure out how to make it so I can drag on my extension's toolbox/toolbars to make the windows for my extension's move.\\n\\nI seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for Thunderbird's main window (and the message view and compose windows.)  Using the Developer Toolbox, I just add Attribute chromemargin=\"0,2,2,2\" (or chromemargin with ANY values, actually) to the <html> tag in the HTML/XUL for the Thunderbird window.  It's like magic.  Add the chromemargin Attribute, and the titlebar disappears, and you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.  Remove the chromemargin Attribute and the titlebar re-appears and you CANNOT drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.\\n\\nThis does not work for the windows for my extension.  Dragging on the toolbox/toolbars does nothing.\\n\\nI have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the Toolbox/toolbars that would respond to mouse drags and I cannot see anything.  Perhaps it's something in the source code for the app itself?  Or some other value stored somewhere, some toolbox or toolbar ID, or CSS class, or attribute or something.  I just don't know.\\n\\nI have tried looking at the Thunderbird source code, and I understand it a bit, but not well enough to figure this out.\\n\\nIf you have any knowledge of this, could you please give me some help?\\n\\nMany thanks in advance,\\n---Mark\\nJust in case anyone is interested in this, user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillaZine:\\n\\nhttp://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3121128&sid=d068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "95  Whoever thought monochrome icons were better than colored (or coloured) ones must have a strange outlook on life.  What's wrong with having a background color attribute for icons, which if a user wants monochrome, can all be set the same?  I use tabs a lot, and particularly dislike the release 78 tabs all being black & white.  Arguments about how to make icons readily distinguishable by shape, miss the point:  colour is the obvious way to make different tab categories immediately distinguishable.  Even if all black & white is the default, the user should be able to assign colours by category, like the previous version where all tabs containing regular folders were yellow, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

We cannot find out what new changes are coming down the pipe until its too late.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

However, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the Add-ons for Thunderbird public listing. URL to ATN listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. Thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server I have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on ATN. Since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to ATN at all.My best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from ATN,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the XPI files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (I think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted XPI points to the correct update.json.

So, I'm sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nMy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/Zulip-Thunderbird\\n\\nThe extension adds an icon to open the Zulip team chat on a Thunderbird tab. The purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. It is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nWithin the Zulip chats (same for Slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to PDF files, etc... when I left-click on these, the Thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. Probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nBut I if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. It takes me to Firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the PDF, and so on...\\n\\nIs there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to Firefox? Or to make it all work within Thunderbird?\\n\\nPS: my extension is quite simple and I'm still learning a lot of details. Please feel free to give feedback and tips on what I should improve. I have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nGerson\\n\\nHm,\\n\\nI do not know if it is related: Do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? It appears those do not work as expected in Thunderbird. Filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nThe link handler of Thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same Thunderbird tab. Links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nTo change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  Add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"&lt;all_urls&gt;\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nYou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. In the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventDefault();\\nevent.stopPropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(anchor.getAttribute('href'));\\n}\\n\\nDoes this help?\\n\\nJohn\\n\\nYes, at the moment I confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nRegarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but I have a busy day of work today. I'll test this changes later tonight and I'll reply here if it works.\\n\\nI've just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nFirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. In zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. To make these work, I need to add the Zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nTo make this work, I had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get('zulip_url');\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startsWith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventDefault();\\n    event.stopPropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendMessage({\\n        data: anchor.getAttribute('href')\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nI'll try this for a couple of days to see if I spot other issues. If you have any suggestion on how I can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks for the help,\\nBest regards,\\nGerson</td>\n",

As in previous years, people eligible to vote and to stand as candidates need to be on an electoral roll. Contributors are eligible to be an elector if they have contributed 10 or more hours per year of involvement in the Thunderbird project. To illustrate this, if a contributor first became involved three years ago then the expected contribution is at least 30 hours, if two years ago then at least 20 hours, and if one year ago or less then at least 10 hours. Contributors may self-nominate, and on request must submit examples that illustrate their level of involvement.\\n\\nContribution can be any of the following:\\n\\ntriaging bugs;\\nfixing, or reviewing code changes;\\nproviding support on SUMO or other forums;\\nlocalizing Thunderbird, related websites, or extensions;\\ntesting, writing, or reviewing add-ons;\\nfurthering the Thunderbird cause by constructive contributions to tb-planning;\\nor public relations, including writing blog posts, posting on social media, artwork, etc.\\nPeople working for Mozilla who dedicate time to Thunderbird are also eligible.\\n\\nThis simple rule will spare us any complicated metric, such as ‚Äúx number of patches submitted‚Äù, ‚Äúx bugs submitted‚Äù or ‚Äúx SUMO comments written‚Äù, etc. If we have missed a group of contributors, or if you are unsure if your contribution qualifies, please reach out to the Council (at council@thunderbird.net), or me personally.\\n\\nSince we already know some of the people who are dedicating time, their most precious asset, to Thunderbird, we have prepared a preliminary electoral roll based on previous years. The roll is available on GItHub. New additions are listed at the bottom under \"(new for 2022)\".\\nWe ask voters who were previously added to the electoral roll to check for themselves whether they still fulfill the criteria mentioned above and inform us if they are no longer contributing to the Thunderbird project at the required level or do not wish to participate in the election. We also kindly ask you to notify others who may be eligible to self-nominate if you notice someone is missing from the electoral roll.\\nTo reiterate, people who are not on the preliminary electoral roll can contact any member of the Council (at council@thunderbird.net), mentioning their contribution and asking to be added to the electoral roll. The idea is not to make it hard to be on the electoral roll.\\n\\nIn general, the election process will work as in past years (as documented in the bylaws), follow-up emails will include more instructions on the exact timeline, but you will have until at least November 28th, 2022 to be added to the electoral roll.\\nThe election itself will be run by neutral 3rd parties: Peter Saint-Andre, with G. Matthew Rice helping to moderate the list.\\n\\nThanks,\\nAndrei Hajdukewycz\\nThunderbird Council Secretary</td>\n",

       "0  I recently added a beta release, version 7.0b1, of my extension, Clippings for Thunderbird, and selected the option to self-host it so that I can make it available to testers separately while regular users continue to see version 6.3.5, the current release version. However, the beta release is now incorrectly appearing in the Add-ons for Thunderbird public listing. URL to ATN listing: https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/clippings-tb/. Thanks for the report, it is best to file an issue with the addons-server: https://github.com/thunderbird/addons-server I have not looked at it in detail, but self-hosted add-ons need an update_url entry in their manifest and that should prevent it from being accepted on ATN. Since we do not sign add-ons, self-hosted add-ons do not need to be submitted to ATN at all.My best-practice advice is:\\n- remove the beta version from ATN,\\n- create a dedicated branch/repo which holds the update information (either a branch in each add-on repo you want to self-host, or a single update-repo with the information for all your add-ons)\\n- host the XPI files either as an \"beta\" asset in a \"github release\", or directly as a file in the repo (I think the asset is the better choice),\\n- make sure that the manifest of your self-hosted XPI points to the correct update.json. John I've removed the beta version of my extension from ATN, and the listing for my extension now shows the current stable release.

       "1  the Thunderbird team is preparing the next big release: Thunderbird 128 ESR. Now is a good time to check if your add-ons are compatible. Thunderbird 128 is currently being shipped through the beta release channel. If you have not already installed Thunderbird Beta, you can get it from Thunderbird's download page [1]: Select the desired language, your operating system, and switch the \"release channel\" selection to \"Beta\".\\n\\nA list of known required changes to make add-ons compatible with Thunderbird 128 can be found on developer.thunderbird.net [2]. These changes mostly affect Experiment add-ons, which directly interact with Thunderbird code. WebExtensions usually do not need updates, but the add-ons team had to introduce the messagesUpdate permission, and browser.messages.update() will stop working, if the new permission has not been requested.\\nAnother notably change is the official support of Manifest Version 3 in Thunderbird 128. The add-ons team removed deprecated elements and made additional changes to resolve inconsistencies in the APIs. The full list of changes can be found on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [3].\\n\\nStarting with Thunderbird 128, the API documentation on webextension-api.thunderbird.net [4] not only includes the WebExtension APIs added by Thunderbird, but also those inherited from Firefox (Thunderbird and Firefox share a significant amount of code). We are listing only methods, which are actually supported and working.\\n\\nDo not hesitate to reach out for help [5]. Looking forward to see your add-ons running in Thunderbird 128!\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n\\n[1] : https://www.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/all/\\n[2] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/updating/tb128\\n[3] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv3/changes/esr128.html\\n[4] : https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/stable/\\n[5] : https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "2  Hi all, Well I think everything is in the title. We have an extension that shows pdf thumbs in the message pane (faster than openning them). We used to provide PDF.js. Is this still needed? Regards, We usually do not encourage add-ons to depend on files shipped with Thunderbird, because the file could be moved/renamed, which will break your add-on. Ship your own version, so your add-on always uses a known version and stays compatible, even if Thunderbird updates its internal file, which might include API changes which could break your add-on as well.

       "3  I'm studying how to develop addons. So, I'm sorry if my question is noob.\\n\\nMy code is here: https://github.com/gersonjferreira/Zulip-Thunderbird\\n\\nThe extension adds an icon to open the Zulip team chat on a Thunderbird tab. The purpose is to concentrate all chat/email apps into a single window. It is a simple extension and it is working fine... but...\\n\\nWithin the Zulip chats (same for Slack or other examples), there are external links, or links to PDF files, etc... when I left-click on these, the Thunderbird internal browser breaks and stays black. Probably because it cannot show the \"save as\" dialog or \"open with\", and so on...\\n\\nBut I if right-click and select \"open in browser\", it works fine. It takes me to Firefox and opens the desired link, or downloads the PDF, and so on...\\n\\nIs there a way to fix this, so that the left-click takes me to Firefox? Or to make it all work within Thunderbird?\\n\\nPS: my extension is quite simple and I'm still learning a lot of details. Please feel free to give feedback and tips on what I should improve. I have no idea how many people would be interested in using it.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nGerson\\n\\nHm,\\n\\nI do not know if it is related: Do all those \"broken\" a-tags have a target=\"_blank\" attribute? It appears those do not work as expected in Thunderbird. Filed a bug for it:\\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1905616\\n\\nThe link handler of Thunderbird content tabs will always open links of the same site in the same Thunderbird tab. Links to other sites will open in the default browser.\\n\\nTo change this behaviour, you can use a content script.  Add this to your manifest:\\n\\n\"content_scripts\": [ { \"matches\": [\"<all_urls>\"], \"js\": [\"content-script.js\"] } ],\\n\\nYou may limit the content script to a more strict match, if you know which pages you are going to use with your extension. In the content script define a global clickhandler:\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\nevent.preventDefault();\\nevent.stopPropagation();\\n\\nconst anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\nif (!anchor) return;\\nbrowser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(anchor.getAttribute('href'));\\n}\\n\\nDoes this help?\\n\\nJohn\\n\\nYes, at the moment I confirm that all links that fail have target=\"_blank\", so it seems related to the bug you are reporting.\\n\\nRegarding you suggestion, it sounds promising, but I have a busy day of work today. I'll test this changes later tonight and I'll reply here if it works.\\n\\nI've just tested your suggestion, and it helped me identify some details:\\n\\nFirst, indeed the links that need to be fixed are the ones with target=\"_blank\" for sure, but not all of then. In zulip, there are links that start with /user_uploads, like /user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf, and these are the broken ones in my addon. To make these work, I need to add the Zulip prefix \"https://my_org.zulipchat.com/\" + \"/user_uploads/bla_bla.pdf\".\\n\\nTo make this work, I had to split your suggestion into a background and a content-script code like this:\\n// background.js\\nbrowser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (message) {\\n  prefix = browser.storage.sync.get('zulip_url');\\n  prefix.then(function(result) {\\n    let prefix = result.zulip_url;\\n    href = message.data;\\n    if (href.startsWith(\"/user_uploads\")) {\\n      href = prefix + href;\\n    }\\n    browser.windows.openDefaultBrowser(href);\\n  });\\n});\\nand\\n// content-script.js\\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", clickhandler);\\n\\nfunction clickhandler(event) {\\n    event.preventDefault();\\n    event.stopPropagation();\\n\\n    const anchor = event.target.closest(\"a\");\\n    if (!anchor) return;\\n    browser.runtime.sendMessage({\\n        data: anchor.getAttribute('href')\\n    });\\n};\\n\\nI'll try this for a couple of days to see if I spot other issues. If you have any suggestion on how I can improve this code, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks for the help,\\nBest regards,\\nGerson   \n",
       "4  I think this is going to require some expertise from someone who knows how Thunderbird works internally, but I thought I would ask anyway.\\n\\nWhen you set mail.tabs.drawInTitlebar=true in the Config Editor, the OS-supplied titlebar -- with the window title and the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons -- is hidden, and Thunderbird-supplied equivalents for the buttons are added instead.  This is great.\\n\\nAnother thing that happens is that you can DRAG in the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window to move the Thunderbird window around, as the titlebar is no longer available for this purpose.  This is also great.\\n\\nI have been trying to implement the same behavior for an extension I have been working on.  I can hide the OS-supplied titlebar and add my own buttons, and that is working well, but I cannot figure out how to make it so I can drag on my extension's toolbox/toolbars to make the windows for my extension's move.\\n\\nI seem to have isolated what triggers this behavior for Thunderbird's main window (and the message view and compose windows.)  Using the Developer Toolbox, I just add Attribute chromemargin=\"0,2,2,2\" (or chromemargin with ANY values, actually) to the <html> tag in the HTML/XUL for the Thunderbird window.  It's like magic.  Add the chromemargin Attribute, and the titlebar disappears, and you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.  Remove the chromemargin Attribute and the titlebar re-appears and you CANNOT drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window.\\n\\nThis does not work for the windows for my extension.  Dragging on the toolbox/toolbars does nothing.\\n\\nI have looked to see what event listeners might be attached to the Toolbox/toolbars that would respond to mouse drags and I cannot see anything.  Perhaps it's something in the source code for the app itself?  Or some other value stored somewhere, some toolbox or toolbar ID, or CSS class, or attribute or something.  I just don't know.\\n\\nI have tried looking at the Thunderbird source code, and I understand it a bit, but not well enough to figure this out.\\n\\nIf you have any knowledge of this, could you please give me some help?\\n\\nMany thanks in advance,\\n---Mark\\nJust in case anyone is interested in this, user morat provided the answer in this article on mozillaZine:\\n\\nhttp://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3121128&sid=d068573e2643604e638528cdb09a5a63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "6  So, I have a content script that I'm writing, but calls to console.log() do not appear on the debug console launched with the inspect button. Messages from the background script and a popup.js I registered via the manifest appear fine. If it matters, the script is a message display script that is invoked by injecting the script the same way it is done in the message-content-script example - not via manifest. Do I need to set something in the debug console or manifest to see these messages?\\nThe script has registered an onMessage listener, but on sending a message from the background script I get \"Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist\" thrown form the sending (background) code. The script definitely runs when I select the message, as I can see the redboxed text that was used in the message-content-script example. I just can't get it to react to a message form the background. I understand that the script will be sleeping/inactive normally, but shouldn't it wake on receipt of an onMessage? Is it even possible to listen to messages from the background in a content script? Or should I be injecting the code freshly somehow?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Prompt for Folder Name, and creates a mail filter which will store sent emails and incoming emails in the new folder based on domain name (or other entered text).\\nIf a matching config exists already for the received email (using the mail filter), the button would be to send this email there instead (like when done reviewing in inbox).\\nAnother button for schedule response - when clicked, would prompt for a date and title/desc (can schedule be in TB directly or utilize calendar features?). Once added and the date/time arrives, TB will pop up the text entered. \"Check back with client regarding...\" Most likely, an upcoming list of scheduled items could appear where the current 'task' list would be (when using the calendar in TB).\\n\\nSo, that is the jist of it. Super basic way to manage when the user wants to respond/check back to a clients email. Probably more stuff later, but this would improve my process enough I would not need the hassle of an entirely different CRM software.\\n\\nThanks, Wes\\nHi Wes,\\n\\nI have seen a few CRM add-ons passing through review, for example\\n\\n* https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/rt-archive-emails-to-crm/\\n* https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/kundenmeister-mail-export/\\n\\nThose seem to work only with specific systems, but they might give an impression of what is possible.\\n\\nYou can:\\n* have a button in the message header area\\n* you can create folders\\n* you can prompt the user in popus or in the options page for configuration data\\n* you cannot yet create a \"real\" email filter (one which shows up in Thunderbirds filters), but you can react on incoming email and do something with new mail\\n* you can implement a reminder functionality, or use https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/mailmindr/ (or cooperate with that add-on: add-ons can communicate with other add-ons if they implement a public API)\\n\\nHope that helps,\\nJohn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "8  Hello Mozillians and friends of Thunderbird,\\n\\nThe next Thunderbird Council election is coming up. As in previous years, people eligible to vote and to stand as candidates need to be on an electoral roll. Contributors are eligible to be an elector if they have contributed 10 or more hours per year of involvement in the Thunderbird project. To illustrate this, if a contributor first became involved three years ago then the expected contribution is at least 30 hours, if two years ago then at least 20 hours, and if one year ago or less then at least 10 hours. Contributors may self-nominate, and on request must submit examples that illustrate their level of involvement.\\n\\nContribution can be any of the following:\\n\\ntriaging bugs;\\nfixing, or reviewing code changes;\\nproviding support on SUMO or other forums;\\nlocalizing Thunderbird, related websites, or extensions;\\ntesting, writing, or reviewing add-ons;\\nfurthering the Thunderbird cause by constructive contributions to tb-planning;\\nor public relations, including writing blog posts, posting on social media, artwork, etc.\\nPeople working for Mozilla who dedicate time to Thunderbird are also eligible.\\n\\nThis simple rule will spare us any complicated metric, such as ‚Äúx number of patches submitted‚Äù, ‚Äúx bugs submitted‚Äù or ‚Äúx SUMO comments written‚Äù, etc. If we have missed a group of contributors, or if you are unsure if your contribution qualifies, please reach out to the Council (at council@thunderbird.net), or me personally.\\n\\nSince we already know some of the people who are dedicating time, their most precious asset, to Thunderbird, we have prepared a preliminary electoral roll based on previous years. The roll is available on GItHub. New additions are listed at the bottom under \"(new for 2022)\".\\nWe ask voters who were previously added to the electoral roll to check for themselves whether they still fulfill the criteria mentioned above and inform us if they are no longer contributing to the Thunderbird project at the required level or do not wish to participate in the election. We also kindly ask you to notify others who may be eligible to self-nominate if you notice someone is missing from the electoral roll.\\nTo reiterate, people who are not on the preliminary electoral roll can contact any member of the Council (at council@thunderbird.net), mentioning their contribution and asking to be added to the electoral roll. The idea is not to make it hard to be on the electoral roll.\\n\\nIn general, the election process will work as in past years (as documented in the bylaws), follow-up emails will include more instructions on the exact timeline, but you will have until at least November 28th, 2022 to be added to the electoral roll.\\nThe election itself will be run by neutral 3rd parties: Peter Saint-Andre, with G. Matthew Rice helping to moderate the list.\\n\\nThanks,\\nAndrei Hajdukewycz\\nThunderbird Council Secretary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "0  The user has released a beta version 7.0b1 of their extension, Clippings for Thunderbird, and self-hosted it for testing purposes. However, the beta release appeared in the Add-ons for Thunderbird public listing, which is incorrect. The user was advised to file an issue with the addons-server, as self-hosted add-ons need an 'update_url' entry in their manifest to prevent this. The best practice is to remove the beta version from the ATN listing, create a dedicated branch/repo for update information, host the XPI files as a GitHub release asset or repo file, and ensure the manifest points to the correct update.json. The user has since removed the beta version from ATN, correcting the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1  Thunderbird is preparing to release Thunderbird 128 ESR, and add-on developers should check their compatibility. Thunderbird 128 is currently available through the beta release channel on Thunderbird's download page. The main changes affecting add-ons are updates to Experiment add-ons that interact directly with Thunderbird code, the introduction of the messagesUpdate permission for WebExtensions, and the official support of Manifest Version 3. The full list of changes can be found on the appropriate Thunderbird developer websites. Additionally, the API documentation now includes both Thunderbird and Firefox WebExtension APIs, focusing on those that are actually supported and working. Developers are encouraged to reach out for help if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "2  The message is about an extension that displays PDF thumbnails in the message pane for faster access than opening them. Initially, this extension used PDF.js, but the author is questioning if it's still necessary due to potential issues with depending on files shipped with Thunderbird, which could be moved or renamed, breaking the add-on. The author suggests shipping their own version of PDF.js to ensure compatibility, even if Thunderbird updates its internal file, which may include API changes that could also break the add-on. John is likely encouraging developers to handle their dependencies independently to maintain compatibility with different Thunderbird versions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "3  Gerson is developing an addon for Thunderbird that adds an icon to open Zulip team chat. The extension works fine, but when clicking on external links or PDF files within Zulip, Thunderbird's internal browser breaks and stays black. Right-clicking on these links and selecting \"open in browser\" works fine. Gerson is looking for a way to make left-click work as well, or to make it all work within Thunderbird.\\n\\nJohn suggested using a content script, adding an event listener for clicks and overriding the default behavior to open links in the default browser. Gerson tested the suggestion and identified that not all links with target=\"_blank\" are broken, only some of them that start with \"/user_uploads\". Gerson then split John's suggestion into a background and a content-script code, using browser.runtime.sendMessage to add the Zulip prefix to the broken links and open them in the default browser. Gerson will test this solution for a couple of days to see if any other issues arise.                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "4  The user, Mark, is trying to replicate the behavior in Thunderbird where the OS-supplied titlebar with the minimize/maximize/restore/close buttons is hidden and replaced with Thunderbird-supplied equivalents, and where you can drag the window around using the toolbox/toolbars at the top of the window. He has managed to hide the OS-supplied titlebar and add his own buttons in an extension, but cannot make the window dragable with his extension's toolbox/toolbars.\\n\\nHe has found that adding the attribute \"chromemargin='0,2,2,2'\" to the <html> tag in the HTML/XUL for Thunderbird's window makes it work, but this does not work for his extension's windows. He has tried looking for event listeners and can't find anything, and has also looked into Thunderbird's source code but finds it too complex to figure out.

       "5  The user is experiencing a Content Security Policy (CSP) error while attempting to use web workers in their extension, which utilizes a third-party script for processing. The error message suggests that the \"script-src\" directive in the CSP header is blocking the loading of a resource from \"blob:moz-extension://\". The user believes that adding a meta tag in the popup page might solve the issue but is unsure of the exact content.\\n\\nThe issue arises when attempting to create a Worker object in the zip.js library, which offers Web Workers for generating .zip files, and the user is switching from another library due to its inability to handle larger files. The error occurs in the getWebWorker method of zip.js (line 2276). However, the developer of the zip library has suggested a possible solution, which the user has ignored for the time being.

Although messages from the background script and a popup.js registered via the manifest are showing up fine, your content script is not.\\n\\n   Possible causes and solutions:\\n   - Ensure you're opening the correct tab or frame in the debug console.\\n   - Check that Chrome's `--no-sandbox` flag is not being used, as it can prevent scripts from communicating effectively.\\n   - Verify that the content script is loaded in the correct context.\\n\\n2. When sending a message from the background script, you're encountering an \"Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist\" error. The content script runs when you select the message, but it does not react to messages from the background.\\n\\n   Possible causes and solutions:\\n   - Ensure both the background script and content script are correctly specified in the manifest file.  \n",
       "7  Wes is a long-time Thunderbird user and programmer who is interested in developing a CRM add-on for Thunderbird. He wants to know the capabilities and limitations of adding an extension to Thunderbird. His proposed features include:\\n\\n1. A new button on received emails for creating a new mail folder under an existing folder. The button will prompt the user to provide a folder name and create a mail filter that will store sent and incoming emails based on the domain name or entered text. If a matching configuration exists, the button will direct the email to that folder.\\n2. Another button for scheduling responses. When clicked, it will prompt the user to enter a date and title/description. Once the date/time arrives, Thunderbird will pop up the entered text as a reminder to check back with the client. The upcoming scheduled items can appear in the place of the current 'task' list.\\n\\nJohn, a reviewer, acknowledges that there are existing CRM add-ons for Thunderbird but notes that they only work with specific systems. He confirms that Wes can create a button in the message header area, create folders, prompt the user for configuration data, and react to incoming emails.     \n",
       "8  The Thunderbird Council election is approaching, and to be eligible to vote or run as a candidate, individuals must be on an electoral roll. Contributors who have at least 10 hours of involvement per year in the Thunderbird project during the past year are eligible. Contributions can include triaging bugs, fixing or reviewing code changes, providing support, localizing Thunderbird, testing, writing, or reviewing add-ons, furthering the Thunderbird cause, or public relations work. Mozilla employees dedicating time to Thunderbird are also eligible. A simple rule is used instead of complex metrics to determine eligibility. The preliminary electoral roll is available on GitHub, and those who are not on it can request to be added. New additions and changes are listed at the bottom. Voters and eligible individuals should check their status and inform the Council if they no longer meet the eligibility criteria. The election process will follow past years' bylaws, and the election will be run by neutral 3rd parties.                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
